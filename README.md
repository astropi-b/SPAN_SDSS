# SPAN_SDSS
SPAN is a basic, user-friendly spectrum analyzer tailored for spectrum files of SDSS and Simllar Type FITS Files; all you need to provide is the spectrum FITS file of any star of your wish, and you will get the results of the spectrum plot, smoothed spectrum, detection of absorption and emission lines in the spectrum, identification of the corresponding known atomic transition lines, and also the ionization ratio and excitation ratio for hydrogen and calcium.
